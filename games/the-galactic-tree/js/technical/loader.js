Well, who am I to judge? I'll grant you the power to bend the rules. But remember, with every shortcut, you risk stealing away the joy of discovering aspects in the game itself. Unless, of course, you find the journey a bit too slow. In that case… perhaps a little cheating is warranted. The choice is yours. Just remember: power comes with responsibility, and only you can decide how to wield it.",
